# Data

## Description

The data includes information about the following:

* The date, time, and location of the crash
* The type of crash (e.g., car-to-car, car-to-pedestrian)
* The severity of the crash (e.g., property damage only, injuries, fatalities)
* The factors that contributed to the crash (e.g., speeding, drunk driving, distracted driving)
* The demographics of the people involved in the crash (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity)


## Research Plan

The dataset comprises a comprehensive array of variables that align with the research questions outlined in the introduction. The information provided within each column allows for a nuanced exploration of the factors influencing car crash collisions in the city. Let's break down how each variable contributes to answering the research questions:

Geographical Analysis:

BOROUGH: This categorical variable indicates the borough where the collision occurred. It will be instrumental in identifying specific areas with a higher incidence of car crashes, facilitating an analysis of the spatial distribution of collisions within the city.

ZIP CODE: The postal code of the incident occurrence provides a more granular geographical perspective, enabling a detailed examination of collision patterns at the neighborhood level.

LATITUDE and LONGITUDE: These coordinates offer precise spatial information, facilitating mapping and spatial analysis to pinpoint exact locations where collisions are more prevalent.

LOCATION: The latitude and longitude pair in this variable further reinforces the spatial context, allowing for spatial visualization and analysis.

ON STREET NAME and CROSS STREET NAME: These variables offer insights into the specific streets and intersections where collisions occur, contributing to the assessment of road structure and design.

Temporal Analysis:

CRASH DATE and CRASH TIME: These variables provide a temporal dimension to the analysis, allowing for the identification of weekly or daily patterns in the occurrence of car crashes. Examining the temporal aspect is crucial for understanding if there are specific times or days when collisions are more likely.
Causal Factors and Characteristics:

CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1-5: These categorical variables capture the factors contributing to each collision, offering valuable information on the reasons behind crashes. Analyzing these factors will aid in understanding whether issues such as distracted driving or weather conditions are prevalent.

NUMBER OF PERSONS INJURED/KILLED, NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS INJURED/KILLED, NUMBER OF CYCLISTS INJURED/KILLED, NUMBER OF MOTORIST INJURED/KILLED: These numerical variables provide a quantitative overview of the impact of collisions, helping to gauge the severity of incidents.

VEHICLE TYPE CODE 1-5: These variables categorize the types of vehicles involved in each collision. Examining the vehicle types can contribute to understanding collision patterns based on the characteristics of the vehicles.

Identification and Tracking:

COLLISION_ID: This unique identifier serves as the primary key for the dataset, allowing for the tracking and analysis of individual collision records.

In summary, the dataset's rich array of variables facilitates a comprehensive exploration of the spatial, temporal, and causal dimensions of car crash collisions in the city. By leveraging these variables, we can derive meaningful insights into the factors influencing collision patterns and formulate informed recommendations for targeted interventions and policy improvements.
