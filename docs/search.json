    "text": "1 Introduction\nWe chose to study motor vehicle collisions in the city of New York. More than 46,000 people die in car crashes each year, according to Annual United States Road Crash Statistics (ASIRT). The U.S. traffic fatality rate is 12.4 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. New York City is the most populous city in the United States with 19.6 million inhabitants. Almost 45 percent of all households in the city own a car. If we were able to study the reasons behind car crashes, we could attempt to implement methods or practices to reduce fatalities per year. Measures such as including more speed breakers or traffic lights in certain intersections that have frequent car crashes, deploying more police patrols at a certain time or place, or revising certain laws and procedures can help prevent a lot of unnecessary loss of life.\n\n\nOur research delves into a multifaceted examination of the geographical and temporal dimensions of car crash collisions within the urban landscape. A main point of interest in our study is where in the city is most susceptible to vehicular collisions. Perhaps road structure, increased traffic, poor speed limits or other factors could lead to increased frequency of collisions in certain areas. Additionally, our study extends to the temporal realm, aiming to discern patterns associated with the occurrence of car crashes. This involves scrutinizing whether discernible weekly or daily trends manifest in the timing and day of the week when collisions are most prevalent. Furthermore, our investigation delves into the root causes behind car crashes such as driver distraction or poor visibility due to weather conditions. We are also interested in the characteristics of the driver. We are particularly interested in demographic variables such as age, gender, and race, recognizing the potential for these factors to play a role in the occurrence and severity of car collisions."

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nThe dataset comprises a comprehensive array of variables that align with the research questions outlined in the introduction. The information provided within each column allows for a nuanced exploration of the factors influencing car crash collisions in the city. Let’s break down how each variable contributes to answering the research questions:\nGeographical Analysis:\nBOROUGH: This categorical variable indicates the borough where the collision occurred. It will be instrumental in identifying specific areas with a higher incidence of car crashes, facilitating an analysis of the spatial distribution of collisions within the city.\nZIP CODE: The postal code of the incident occurrence provides a more granular geographical perspective, enabling a detailed examination of collision patterns at the neighborhood level.\nLATITUDE and LONGITUDE: These coordinates offer precise spatial information, facilitating mapping and spatial analysis to pinpoint exact locations where collisions are more prevalent.\nLOCATION: The latitude and longitude pair in this variable further reinforces the spatial context, allowing for spatial visualization and analysis.\nON STREET NAME and CROSS STREET NAME: These variables offer insights into the specific streets and intersections where collisions occur, contributing to the assessment of road structure and design.\nTemporal Analysis:\nCRASH DATE and CRASH TIME: These variables provide a temporal dimension to the analysis, allowing for the identification of weekly or daily patterns in the occurrence of car crashes. Examining the temporal aspect is crucial for understanding if there are specific times or days when collisions are more likely. Causal Factors and Characteristics:\nCONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1-5: These categorical variables capture the factors contributing to each collision, offering valuable information on the reasons behind crashes. Analyzing these factors will aid in understanding whether issues such as distracted driving or weather conditions are prevalent.\nNUMBER OF PERSONS INJURED/KILLED, NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS INJURED/KILLED, NUMBER OF CYCLISTS INJURED/KILLED, NUMBER OF MOTORIST INJURED/KILLED: These numerical variables provide a quantitative overview of the impact of collisions, helping to gauge the severity of incidents.\nVEHICLE TYPE CODE 1-5: These variables categorize the types of vehicles involved in each collision. Examining the vehicle types can contribute to understanding collision patterns based on the characteristics of the vehicles.\nIdentification and Tracking:\nCOLLISION_ID: This unique identifier serves as the primary key for the dataset, allowing for the tracking and analysis of individual collision records. In summary, the dataset’s rich array of variables facilitates a comprehensive exploration of the spatial, temporal, and causal dimensions of car crash collisions in the city. By leveraging these variables, we can derive meaningful insights into the factors influencing collision patterns and formulate informed recommendations for targeted interventions and policy improvements."

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\n\n2.1.1 Data Source:\nThe data is taken from the official data catalog of the United States government (data.gov).\n\n\n2.1.2 Data Collection:\nThe Motor Vehicle Collisions crash data contains details on the crash events. Each row represents a crash event. It contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage.\nIt should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details. The most accurate, up to date statistics on traffic fatalities can be found on NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions page, which is updated weekly.\n\n\n2.1.3 Information about the data:\n\nThe data is available in multiple formats but we have used the .csv file.\nThe data contains entries from 2012 to as latest as Nov 25, 2023 and it is updated every week\nThere are 29 features and 2,044,903 entries of crashes.\n\n\nThe data includes information about the following:\n\n\nThe date, time, and location of the crash\nThe type of crash (e.g., car-to-car, car-to-pedestrian)\nThe severity of the crash (e.g., property damage only, injuries, fatalities)\nThe factors that contributed to the crash (e.g., speeding, drunk driving, distracted driving)\nThe demographics of the people involved in the crash (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity)\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Issues with the data:\nOne problems with the data is that there are a lot of missing values in many features that need to be handled.\n\n\n2.1.5 How to import the data:\nWe downloaded the data and read it locally as a csv file to analyse it."
